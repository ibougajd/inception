# Inception Bonus Part Integration Report

This file documents the changes made to the mandatory part to support the bonus services.

## 1. srcs/requirements/wordpress/Dockerfile
- **Change**: Added `php7.4-redis` to the installation command.
- **Reason**: The WordPress container needs the PHP Redis extension to communicate with the Redis Cache service.

## 2. srcs/requirements/wordpress/tools/start.sh
- **Change**: Added WP-CLI commands to:
    - Set `WP_REDIS_HOST` to `redis` and `WP_REDIS_PORT` to `6379` in `wp-config.php`.
    - Install and activate the `redis-cache` plugin.
    - Enable the Redis object cache.
- **Reason**: Automates the configuration of the Redis connection and plugin activation during container startup.

## 3. srcs/docker-compose.yml
- **Change**: Added the following service definitions:
    - `redis`: Redis cache service.
    - `ftp`: VSFTPD server.
    - `adminer`: Database management interface.
    - `website`: Static Node.js website.
    - `cadvisor`: Container monitoring.
- **Change**: Updated `wordpress` service to rely on `redis`.
- **Reason**: Integrating the bonus microservices into the project infrastructure.

## 4. New Directories
- Created `srcs/requirements/bonus/` containing:
    - `redis/`
    - `ftp/`
    - `adminer/`
    - `website/`
    - `cadvisor/`
