# Inception

## Description
This project aims to broaden the knowledge of system administration by using Docker to set up a small infrastructure composed of different services. The main goal is to build a complete web server infrastructure using Docker Compose, understanding the microservices architecture.
It consists of setting up:
- A Docker container with NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.
- A Docker container with WordPress + php-fpm (running without NGINX).
- A Docker container with MariaDB (running without NGINX).
- A Docker network connecting these services.
- Data persistence using Docker Volumes.

## Instructions
This project uses a `Makefile` for easy management.

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make

### Commands
- **Launch the project**:
  ```bash
  make
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  make up
  ```

- **Stop the project**:
  ```bash
  make down
  ```

- **Clean and Rebuild**:
  ```bash
  make re
  ```

- **Clean everything (containers, images, networks, volumes)**:
  ```bash
  make fclean
  ```

## Project Description

### Docker vs Virtual Machines
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Include a full guest operating system (OS) running on top of a hypervisor. This requires significant resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) for each instance as they essentially emulate an entire hardware stack.
- **Docker**: Uses containerization to share the host OS kernel. Containers are lightweight, start almost instantly, and use significantly fewer system resources than VMs. They package code and dependencies together, ensuring consistency across environments.

### Secrets vs Environment Variables
- **Environment Variables**: Useful for configuration settings (like debug flags, paths). However, they can be insecure for sensitive data as they might be visible in process listings or logs.
- **Secrets**: Designed specifically for managing sensitive data (passwords, certificates). In this project, we simulate secret management by storing sensitive data in files within the `secrets/` directory or strictly controlled `.env` files that are not committed to version control in a production environment.

### Docker Network vs Host Network
- **Host Network**: The container shares the networking namespace of the host. Port conflicts can easily occur.
- **Docker Network**: Creates isolated networks (like the bridge network `n1` used here). Containers can communicate with each other securely using their service names (e.g., `wordpress` connects to `mariadb`), and only specific ports are exposed to the host/world (e.g., port 443).

### Docker Volumes vs Bind Mounts
- **Bind Mounts**: Map a file or directory on the host machine to the container. Great for development where code changes on the host need to be reflected immediately.
- **Docker Volumes**: Managed by Docker in a specific part of the host filesystem (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). They are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers, offering better backup and migration capabilities.

## Resources
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- **AI Usage**: Artificial Intelligence tools were utilized in this project for the following tasks:
  - **Code Auditing**: Automated analysis of configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) to ensure compliance with project requirements.
  - **Documentation Generation**: Generating drafts for `README.md`, `USER_DOC.md`, and `DEV_DOC.md` based on the project structure and subject PDF.
